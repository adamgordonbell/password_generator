1. Ensure your Flask app is in a file named `app.py` or `main.py` at the root of your project.

2. Create a `requirements.txt` file in your project root if you don't have one already:

```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

3. Add `gunicorn` to your `requirements.txt` file:

```
echo "gunicorn" >> requirements.txt
```

4. Create a `Procfile` in your project root with the following content:

```
web: gunicorn app:app
```

Replace `app:app` with `main:app` if your Flask app is in `main.py`.

5. If your Flask app isn't already configured to use environment variables for things like the secret key or database URL, update it to do so:

```python
import os
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', 'fallback_secret_key')
# Add other configuration variables as needed

# Your routes and other app code here
```

6. Push these changes to your GitHub repository.

7. In Railway, create a new project and select "Deploy from GitHub repo".

8. Choose your repository and the branch you want to deploy.

9. Railway should automatically detect that it's a Python project and set up the build accordingly.

10. If you need to set environment variables (like `SECRET_KEY`), you can do so in the Railway dashboard under the "Variables" tab.

11. Once deployed, Railway will provide you with a URL where your app is live.

If you encounter any issues with the automatic build, you can add a `railway.json` file to your project root with the following content:

  }
}
```

6. Create a `.gitignore` file in your project root:

```
# .gitignore
__pycache__/
*.pyc
```

7. Initialize a git repository (if you haven't already):

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

8. Push your code to a GitHub repository.

9. In Railway, create a new project and select "Deploy from GitHub repo".
